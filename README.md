### Fundamentals of 3D Graphics + Extra project

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In most of the practices, you can use the keys "A," "D," "S," "W" to move, "Q" and "E" to rotate, "F" and "G" to scale it (in some exercises), and the arrow keys as well as "1" and "2" for other functions if the program allows.

- 1.- Parallel projection
- 2.-Perspective projection
- 3.- 3D translation
- 4.- 3D scaling
- 5.- 3D rotation
- 6.- Automatic 3D rotation
- 7.- Drawing a 3D parametric curve
- 8.- Drawing a 3D surface
- 9.- Drawing a cylinder

# Project
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project is the culmination of everything learned up to the point of developing these algorithms, both in 2D and 3D. We can observe the animation of the classic 'Pac-Man' as it eats the enemies or other items that we can find within the video game, accompanied by some music.

You can use 'A', 'D', 'S', and 'W' to rotate the animation, 'F' and 'G' to scale it, 'M' and 'N' to pause or resume, and 'Q' and 'E' to change the object that Pac-Man is consuming.
